         <h3>Osaka</h3>

         <!--paragraph about Osaka-->
         <p>Osaka is our favorite city to stay in. It serves as a great hub by not being too expensive and is centrally located throughout the country. As Japan's 2md largest city, there is so much to see and do. </p>

         <h3>Tokyo</h3>

         <!--paragraph about Tokyo-->
         <p>One of my favorite memories from this trip was landing at the airport and going stright to the hotel. We were hungry, it was late and the only place open was the rooftop restaurant. We went up there and got seated, only to realize we had the entire restaurant to ourselves and we had a view for miles over the city. It was amazing!</p>

         <!--paragraph about Nara-->
         <p>Nara was super fun. I had really wanted to go to see the bowing deer and the beautiful temples. We were not disappointed.</p>
